# gluttony

This will be a quiz app. There will be a homepage with the option to either play or see highscores. When the user clicks play a timer will begin a countdown.
If the user selects a wrong answer it will make a red background to indicate incorrect and a green background to indicate correct answer.
The quiz will end once all the questions have been answered or the timer reaches zero. The user can save their highscore and name or try again.
Saving will automatically return the user to the homepage.
